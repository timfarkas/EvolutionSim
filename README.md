# EvolutionSim
This project is an implementation of the Wright-Fisher model of evolutionary dynamics. It allows quick and easy simulation of the following properties and phenomena of evolutionary processes:
- mutation & reproductive advantage
- selection
- mutation fixation probabilities
- logistic population growth
- population bottlenecks
- seasonal variation of reproductive advantage

For the purposes of our implementation, we assumed haploid, asexual reproduction. For simplicity, we did not model clonal interference dynamics, however, the code was designed to allow easy


### Context
EvoSim was drafted and realized as a group project over in ~10 working hours at the working group "Quantitatively Modeling Evolution" at a summer academy by the German scholarship foundation in Leysin, Switzerland. Our group consisted of four scholarship holders with different backgrounds:
- Johanna Buth (biology)
- Georg Eichler (maths)
- Mathilda Harbering (law)
- Tim Farkas (medicine, CS)
