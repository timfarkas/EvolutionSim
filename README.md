# EvolutionSim
This project is an implementation of the Wright-Fisher model of evolutionary dynamics. It allows quick and easy simulation of the following properties and phenomena of evolutionary processes:
- mutation & reproductive advantage
- selection
- mutation fixation probabilities
- logistic population growth
- population bottlenecks
- seasonal variation of reproductive advantage
